Modify the pins.txt file with the desired pin mapping and copy it to the Android Download directory. Ths file is read when the App starts. The file pins_std.txt is just for reference for a standard mapping in which the logical and physical pins are the same.

The App needs the following permissions:

- Place/GPS (Plats)

- Storage (Lagring) This one needs to be added manually by going to preferences->Apps->NEMS
